# Profiles

Profiles model environments such as `production`, `staging`, and `preview`.

## Shape

```yaml
projects:
  api:
    profiles:
      production:
        branch: main
        domain: "api.example.com"

      staging:
        branch: develop
        domain: "api.example-test.com"
```

## Common Fields

### `branch`

The branch to deploy for the environment.

### `domain`

The hostname for the environment.

### `databases`

Environment-specific database declarations.

### `infrastructure`

Environment-specific infrastructure behavior such as server reuse or provisioning.

## Example

```yaml
projects:
  api:
    provider: hosting
    profiles:
      production:
        branch: main
        domain: "api.example.com"

      preview:
        branch: "${GITHUB_HEAD_REF}"
        domain: "api-preview-${GITHUB_PR_NUMBER}.example.com"
        databases:
          main:
            name: "myapp_preview_${GITHUB_PR_NUMBER}"
            user: "myapp_preview_${GITHUB_PR_NUMBER}"
            type: mysql
        infrastructure:
          server:
            mode: create
            name: "api-preview-${GITHUB_PR_NUMBER}"
            cleanup: destroy
```

## Failure Modes

- putting profile fields at project level: move them into the correct environment block
- reusing production domains in non-production profiles: keep domains unique by environment
- mixing preview variables into long-lived environments: only use dynamic preview naming where intended
